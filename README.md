## 📖 Introduction
**Roaming SPACE** is a 3D first-person game developed as a Final Year Project (CCIT4080B) at HKU SPACE Community College. It uses the Kowloon East Campus (KEC) as a 1:1 scale map blueprint. The project aims to gamify the campus navigation experience, helping freshmen familiarize themselves with the KEC structure in an immersive and memorable way, replacing traditional, monotonous orientation methods.

## 🎮 Game Modes
The game features two distinct modes to cater to different player experiences:

### 1. Free Mode (Visit Mode)
- **Objective:** Freely explore the KEC campus.
- **Features:** Navigate through different floors (G/F to 10/F) at your own pace. Interactive exclamation marks ("sightseeing spots") in rooms display real-life photos of the actual campus facilities, helping players recognize the real-world environment.

### 2. Horror Mode
- **Objective:** Survive, solve puzzles, and save your GPA!
- **Story:** Players take on the role of a "Free-Rider" whose grades have been paused by the "GPA God" and "Offer God". You must find all the keys to reunite your body and soul.
- **Features:** Immersive horror atmosphere with eerie lighting, low visibility, and gloomy sound effects. If you fail to answer questions or solve puzzles, an AI-controlled monster (chase mechanism) will track you down.

## ✨ Key Features
- **1:1 Campus Recreation:** A highly detailed 3D restoration of the HKU SPACE KEC (approximately 70-80% accuracy of accessible areas).
- **First-Person Perspective:** Enhances immersion and exploration.
- **Interactive Elements:** Real photo integration for educational purposes.
- **Unique Concept:** The first horror game utilizing the HKU SPACE KEC as its background.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Game Engine:** Unity (C#)
- **3D Modeling:** Blender
- **Design:** Scene layering for optimized loading.

*Special thanks to all beta testers and freshmen who provided valuable feedback during development!*

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Completion of missing campus floors and seamless integration via Unity Addressables.
- Multi-language support (English, Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese).
- Enhanced AI behavior trees and interactive mechanics (e.g., opening/closing doors).
- Potential integration into the official HKU SPACE network for orientation purposes.
